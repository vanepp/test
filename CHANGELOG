0.0.2 - 2017-12-31

	- Fixed the logic of detecting not a file or not an svg and not an fzp
	  in argument parsing and corrected the if to be more readable

	- removed the numbers from all the Usage: statements in argument 
	  parsing. Moved out of Errors section in to a Usage section as well. 

	- Added FileType back in to multiple function calls as it is in fact
	  needed where it was (and broke svg processing when removed). 

	- Changed names of README.md CHANGELOG.md COULDDO.md to README
	  CHANGELOG and COULDDO as they are plain text files and don't display
	  correctly in the repo as .md files.

	- Moved tests for connectors being present from ProcessTree in to 
	  ProcessSvgsFromFzp which is more efficient and more likely to 
	  work (connectors were not being checked entirely before)
	
	- Added IssueDescriptionDupWarning (default value y) to be able to  
	  supress warnings about duplicate names in the description field
	  (because they are both common and harmless). Documented in README.

	- Added a regex to remove leading blanks from the attributes in 
	  SVGInlineStyle because they cause a value exception in lxml. This 
	  should mostly eliminate Warning 23 messages (and allow the one non 
	  core file I have found that this breaks to be processed correctly).
	  Still occurs on Inkscape messages like this:
	  
	  -inkscape-font-specification

	  I think because of the '-' in the data although I'm not sure why but 
	  Fritzing ignores this field anyway so it doesn't hurt anything to 
	  delete it.

	- add the version number to all the .py files. 
	  FritzingCheckPart.py  FritzingTools.py  PP.py  PPTools.py

	- Added a file copy of the input icon svg to the output svg as the 
	  icon file isn't processed but needs to be in the output. Don't
	  do the copy if Debug is non zero as the file names will be the same
	  and cause an exception (and the output is going the console anyway).

	- Added the name of the svg file to the Error 18 message as it is 
	  remarkably content free and useless without it. 

	- Moved the "processed this svg" check after the test if this is icon
	  view to avoid outputting an error message for icon view (which we
	  end up not processing anyway).
